### Occupational Safety and Health in Industry 5.0

Enhancing Workplace Safety Through Personalized Environmental Risk Assessment: An AI-driven Approach in Industry 5.0

The theme of this project is a monitoring system to measure dust, noise, ultraviolet radiation, illuminance, temperature, and humidity and to check the presence of flammable gases—liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), propane, hydrogen, butane, methane, and carbon monoxide. The system is composed of the following parts:
Monitoring devices: they must be clipped to the employees’ clothes to collect measures and send them via encryption through the Internet to the server.
Server: It runs applications to collect, process, and display data received from the monitoring devices. The server hosts a web application that allows companies to register employees and provide their health information.
Mobile application: it is intended for workers to check their exposure data.
The figure below explains the overview of the proposed architecture.

The project is organized as follows:
- <b>ia_model</b>: contains the project structure divided into the following resources:
  - <i>connectors</i>: contains the Postgres class that allows connecting/querying data from the relational database.
  - <i>migrations</i>: contains the PostgresSchema class responsible for generating the data structure for storing synthetic data generated by sensor type, enabling the development of AI models.
  - <i>datasets</i>: directory structure necessary for the data generation script to be able to save and access sensor data during model training.
  - <i>experiment_models</i>: contains the Jupyter Notebook files:
    - a) <i>generate_dataset_sensors.ipynb</i>: responsible for encapsulating the sequence of steps to generate synthetic data per sensor, and exporting it from Postgres to pandas format, facilitating model training.
    - b) <i>views_for_models.ipynb</i>: responsible for generating the random tree graph.
    - c) <i>metrics_*_.xls</i>: brings together all metrics (precision, recall, f1, roc-auc) from the training and testing stages for all models tested per sensor.
    - d) <i>*_sensor subdirectories</i>: contains a Jupyter notebook file "exploration_ia_models_*_sensor.ipynb" that encapsulates the steps to generate the models and collect the data, saving the model and metrics for the sensor in the respective directory of the same name.
    - e) <i>graphs</i>: brings together some plots grouping results of the tested models.
  - <i>ClassifierModels</i>: responsible for encapsulating the tests of different shallow learning models 
  - <i>ModelTests</i>: responsible for standardizing test execution, saving models and metrics collected during the training and testing phase.
  - <i>XboostModel</i>: class responsible for generating the XBoost model, and collecting evaluation metrics according to other tests.
  - <i>requeriments.txt</i>: contains all libraries used in this project.
- <b>utils</b>: contains auxiliary functions for other classes in this project.
